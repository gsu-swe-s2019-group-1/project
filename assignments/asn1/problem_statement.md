It will allow the customers to open their accounts, manage them electronically,
to monitor them, to make transactions, pay their bills, transfer money, make
deposits, and so on.

 ### Why is this project compelling and worth developing?
 
This product is worth developing because it would reduce costs for banks by reducing the amount of human labor required. Additionally, an electronic banking system would enable banks to keep stringent records. A computerized ledger would reduce the number of mistakes when calculating interests, making transactions, and so on. Finally, our application increases the amount of customer interaction because they would have access to our banks from any place with WiFi. 

### Describe the top-level objectives, differentiators, target customers, and scope of your product.

- Objective: To create a product that performs to our requirements and have it sustainable for multiple lifecycles.
- Differentiators: Our system won’t sell data to any third parties, have no hidden transaction fees, and will not participate in predatory lending practices
- Target customers: Our target customer is the average citizen, anyone that currently uses or will use a bank for their transaction needs. 
- Scope: The scope of our project is building an online business ledger, making a database to store our information, developing a web app and making a UI for our customers.

### What are the competitors and what is novel in your approach?

Our competitors are Finacle, nCino, Oracle, etc. What we bring new to the table is that our system will be entirely online. Additionally, our platform is customer focused and has full transparency. We won’t sell customer data or charge hidden fees.

### Make it clear that the system can be built, making good use of the available resources and technology.

Our system is possible because it will be very simplistic and direct. Clients will connect to our application software where they will be greeted by a user-friendly interface, which will primarily be coded in HTML. We will complement this with CSS to create a stylistic design for our clients. Finally, the frontend of our application will be connected to a backend SQL database. Our database will be responsible for recording transactions such as withdrawals, deposits, bill pays, and more.

### What is interesting about this project from a technical point of view?

The interesting part about this project will be using our creativity to design a nice interface for our clients. Additionally, connecting this frontend to our database for the banking transactions will also be fun to do.
